# RazorPagesTest (Recipe App)

This is a sample razor pages project. It should allow the user to add/edit/delete/view/search food recipes. It should include the following:

- A data model to hold a recipe, its ingredients, and the preparation instructions. Each recipe should also have a category, like Breakfast, Dessert, etc. Each recipe can also have optional tags.
- Code-first migrations using mssqllocaldb.
- The database should be seeded with at least 10 sample recipes of various categories.
- A page that contains a grid that allows the user to see all recipes in the database. It should allow the user to search, sort, filter. It should also allow the user to delete a recipe. It should also allow the user to search by ingredient and let them enter multiple ingredients, which they might have in their kitchen. The results of this search would be a list of recipes that are sorted by how closely they match the ingredient list the user entered.
- A page to add a recipe or edit an existing recipe. This should also allow the user to assign a category and optional tags.
- A page to view a recipe. The view should be formatted to allow it to be nicely printed.
- The website should look stylish and modern. It should be mobile friendly.
